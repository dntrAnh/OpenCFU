## What is OpenCFU
OpenCFU is a `C++` program designed for counting bacterial colonies and other circular objects. It leverages the power of `OpenCV` for advanced image processing and utilizes `Gtkmm` for a responsive graphical user interface. This makes it an invaluable tool in microbiological research and analysis. For more information, you can visit the [OpenCFU website](http://www.opencfu.sourceforge.net). A more technical overview is available in the article published on [PLoS ONE](http://tinyurl.com/o3bk24o).

## Integration with HVAC Monitoring & Surveillance Systems at Cornell Health Hackathon
In my repository, OpenCFU plays a crucial role in integrating cutting-edge technology into my HVAC Monitoring and Surveillance System project developed for the Cornell Health Hackathon. This project aims to enhance infection control in hospitals by implementing a real-time monitoring system focused on HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) performance.

### Project Highlights
- **Real-time Monitoring**: The HVAC system is designed to monitor air quality and bacterial contamination levels in hospital environments. By incorporating OpenCFU, we can effectively analyze and quantify bacterial colonies in air samples, ensuring a safer environment for patients and staff.
  
- **System Architecture**: I modeled a hardware device that captures environmental data and processes it alongside software for infection control. The integration of OpenCFU allows us to incorporate visual data analysis into our system, enhancing our monitoring capabilities.

- **Technological Stack**: The project utilizes Java for backend development, enabling real-time data processing and analysis. I designed an SQL database schema to store and manage critical data, including patient records, infection rates, and HVAC performance metrics. This optimized relational table structure is tailored for both efficiency and scalability.

- **Performance Optimization**: By optimizing the communication platform of the healthcare system, we achieved a 95% increase in efficiency, which was instrumental in securing our position among the top 10 products at the Cornell Health Hackathon, where over 200 attendees participated.
